# politeiawww API Specification

# v2

This document describes the v2 REST API provided by a `politeiawww` server.
The `politeiawww` server is the web server backend that interacts with clients
using a JSON REST API.

**Vote Routes**

- [`Start vote`](#start-vote)
- [`Vote details`](#vote-details)

### `Start vote`

Start the voting period on the given proposal.

Signature is a signature of the hex encoded SHA256 digest of the JSON encoded
v2 Vote struct.

Differences between v1 and v2 StartVote:
* Signature has been updated to be a signature of the Vote hash. It was
  previously a signature of just the proposal token.
* Vote has been updated. See the Vote comment below for more details.

Differences between v1 and v2 Vote:
* Added the "version" field that specifies the version of the proposal that is
  being voted on. This was added so that the proposal version is explicitly
  included in the StartVote signature.
* Added the "type" field that specifies the vote type.

Differences between v1 and v2 StartVoteReply:
* StartBlockHeight was changed from a string to a uint32.
* EndBlockHeight was changed from a string to a uint32. It was also renamed
  from EndHeight to EndBlockHeight to be consistent with StartBlockHeight.

### `Vote details`

Vote details returns all of the relevant proposal vote information for the
given proposal token.  This includes all of the vote parameters and voting
options.

The returned version specifies the start vote version that was used to initiate
the voting period for the given proposal. See the [`Start vote`](#start-vote)
documentation for more details on the differences between the start vote
versions.

The "vote" field is a base64 encoded JSON byte slice of the Vote and will need
to be decoded according to the returned version. See the
[`Start vote`](#start-vote) documentation for more details on the differences
between the Vote versions.

**Route:** `GET /v2/vote/{token}`

**Results (VoteDetailsReply):**

| | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| version | uint32 | Start vote version |
