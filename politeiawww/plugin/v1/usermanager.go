// database that cannot be done inside of plugins.
//
// For example, plugins do not have access to the user database methods that
// insert users into the database. These actions must be done by the backend.
// The UserManager interface allows plugins to add plugin specific behavior
// onto these actions.
//
// Any changes made to the User during method execution will be persisted by
// the caller.

	// NewUserCmd executes a command that results in a new user being added to
	// the database. The user provided to this method is a newly created user
	// that has not been inserted into the user database yet, but will be
	// inserted if this command executes successfully without any user errors
	// or unexpected errors.
