politeia v1.3.0
====

This release includes the following additions and improvements. See the
changelog for the full list of changes.

- **Preps the codebase for the user layer rewrite.** The majority of the LOC
  changes made in this release are changes made in preparation for the user
  layer rewrite. This includes pulling apart code and separating concerns that
  were too tightly coupled with the legacy code and moving all of the legacy
  code into a `legacy` package that will be removed at some point in the
  future.

- **Improves the billing status API.** Billing statuses were updated to allow
  for error correction. By default, only a single billing status change is
  allowed. This is now configurable by the sysadmin to allow for error
  correction in the event that an admin makes a mistake when updating a
  proposal's billing status.

- **Parallelize politeiavoter trickling.** The user now has the option to
  parallelize their vote trickling using up to 100 concurrent threads. The
  threads will start trickling votes in at random, uncorrelated times, further
  improving privacy and making the trickling process more robust.

**Note: You must update your politeiavoter binary if you use the politeiavoter
trickling feature. Retry attempts for failed votes will not work properly if
you do not update.**
