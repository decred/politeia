politeia v1.2.0
====

This release includes the following feature additions, bug fixes and
improvements.

- **Proposal author updates ([#1491](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1491)).**
  Proposal authors are now able to give updates on the status of their
  proposal. Once the proposal is approved, the author can can start new comment
  threads that server as update threads until the proposal has been marked as
  closed or completed by an admin. 

- **Proposal billing statuses ([#1480](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1480)).**
  Billing statuses (active, closed, completed) have been added to proposals.
  Once a proposal has been approved, the billing status is considered to be
  active. Admins can mark the billing status of a proposal as completed or
  closed in order to prevent further billing against the proposal. The
  completed billing status indicates the proposal has successfully delivered
  all promised work and is no longer being billed against. The closed billing
  status means that the proposal work has not been fully delivered, but further
  billing against the proposal is no longer allowed. These billing statuses
  will allow CMS, Decred's contractor management system, to further automate
  the Decred treasury billing process.

- **Proposal statuses ([#1515](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1515)).**
  A proposal status type has been added to the pi plugin that is used to map
  all possible paths a proposal can take throughout its lifecycle. This status
  is determined at runtime by combining the metadata from the various plugins
  (record status changes, vote status changes, billing status changes, etc).
  This status removes complexity from the client and serves as the source of
  truth for how the various plugin metadata impacts a proposal.

- **OOM hardening.**
  The Politeia servers have experienced a few "out of memory" errors since the
  last release. This was due to the combination of a memory leak in politeiad
  and a server config that was too restrictive with regards to allowed memory
  usage of the politeiad process. These issues have been fixed and additional
  measures have been implemented in order to increase the security and
  stability of the Politeia servers.
