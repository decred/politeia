politeia v1.2.0
====

This release includes the following feature additions, bug fixes and improvements.

- **Proposal billing statuses** Politeia admins are now able to set a billing
status (active, closed and completed) for a proposal that has been approved by
the Decred stakeholders.

- **Proposal author updates** Proposal authors are now able to give periodic
updates on the status of their proposal. With this feature, once the proposal
is approved, the author will be able to open new comment threads to provide
updates for the community.

- **Server hardening** Improvements were made to increase security and 
stability of the Politeia servers. Close an open deblob reader (#1500) which
caused memory leakage, add read size limits to politeiawww's http and
websocket server (#1506), and apply connection timeouts to http servers
(#1505).

Note: In order to enable proposal author updates, the plugin settings
`pluginsetting=comments,allowextradata,true` must be added to politeiad config.
Check [1491](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/1491) for more details
on this change.
