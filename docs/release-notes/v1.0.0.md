# politeia v1.0.0

This release of politeia introduces a large number of structural changes to
politeia and deprecates many of the existing politeiawww API routes.  Listed
below are a summary of the changes.

- Adds a new politeiad backend called tstore.
- Adds a politeiad v2 API.
- Formalizes a politeiad plugin architecture.
- Adds the following politeiad plugins: `comments`, `ticketvote`, `dcrdata`,
  `usermd`, `pi`.
- Support has been removed for the politeiawww `www/v1` API routes that handle
  proposals, comments, and dcr ticket votes.  Routes that are used by decred
  clients (decrediton, dcrdata) have only been deprecated and will have support
  removed in the future.
- Adds the following politeiawww APIs: `records/v1`, `comments/v1`,
  `ticketvote/v1`.

## politeiad tstore backend

A new backend was added to politeiad that is referred to as the tstore backend.
  It combines a trillian log, commonly referred to as a tlog, and a key-value
  store. The tstore backend differs from the git backend in three main ways.

1. Scalability
  The git backend relied on git repos saved to the file system to store data.
  This approach cannot be scaled out since it is constrained to the file system
  of a single politeiad instances. The tstore backend moves the data into an
  actual database, allowing for much greater scalability.

2. Separate the timestamps and the data blobs
  The git backend would timestamp the git commit hashes onto the decred
  blockchain. These commit hashes are merkle roots of all the files in the
  commit. The timestamp and the data blobs in this setup are interconnected. If
  you delete a data blob from the commit history, such as if you need to censor
  a public comment, you destroy the ability to recreate the merkle path for
  other data blobs included in that commit merkle root, thus destroying the
  ability to prove inclusion of data in a decred timestamp. Your only option is
  to remove the data from the git repo in a new commit, but the censored data
  remains in the git history. The tstore backend seperates out the timestamps
  from the data blobs. A merkle tree of the data is stored in a tlog instance
  while the data itself is stored in a key-value database. This allows for the
  deletion of data from the database, such as if you need to censor a public
  comment, without impacting any of the timestamps or our ability to prove the
  inclusion of a piece of data in a timestamp.

3. Ability to retrieve timestamp inclusion proofs
  The tstore backend gives us the ability to retrieve an inclusion proof for
  any piece of data in the backend, providing cryptographic proof that the data
  blob was included in a dcr timestamp. There was no easy way to do this in the
  git backend.

## politeiad v2 API

A politeiad v2 API was added. This API is a simplified version of the politeiad
v1 API. The tstore backend relies solely on the politeiad v2 API.

## politeiad plugin architecture

A formalized plugin architecture was added to politeiad.

A politeiad plugin extends a record with additional functionality. Some
examples of this include adding comments to a record, adding the ability to
run a dcr ticket vote on a record, and adding record validation that is
specific to the decred proposal system.

This plugin architecture allows politeiad to become a configurable system. If a
user wants to runs a politeiad instance that allows for specific file types and
record comments, they can do so by simply adjusting the politeiad
configuration. No new code is required unless they want to add in more
granular, application specific validation.

The end goal is to eventually allow plugin code to exist outside of the
politeia repository that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. While this is
not possible yet, this release lays the foundation for doing so in the future.

## politeiad plugins

The following plugins have been added to politeiad:

- `comments` - extends a record with comment functionality.
- `ticketvote` - extends a record with dcr ticket vote functionality.
- `dcrdata` - provides an API that plugins can use to retreive data from
  dcrdata.
- `usermd` - extends a record with user metadata (ex. user signatures).
- `pi` - extends a record with functionality specific to the decred proposal
  system.

## politeiawww APIs

The following politeiawww APIs have been added:

- `records/v1`
- `comments/v1`
- `ticketvote/v1`

The politeiawww APIs have been rewritten to be generic, application agnostic
APIs. These APIs were formally tied to specific politeia applications such as
the decred proposal system and the decred contractor management system. You
would use a proposal route to submit new proposals and a separate invoice route
to submit cms invoices. These application specific routes have been replaced
with more generic APIs. For example, there now exists a single set of routes
for submitting all records, regardless of whether that record is a proposal or
an invoice. The application specific validation has been pushed into the
politeiad plugins. The validation that is specific to proposals is now
performed in the `pi` politeiad plugin.

The politeiawww APIs now map to the politeiad plugins. For example, the
politeiad comments plugin has a corresponding politeiawww API that can be used
for submitting comments on any record, regardless of whether its a proposal
comment or invoice comment.

These application agnostic APIs allow politeia to become a configurable system.
You configure the politeiad plugins for your specific use case and you
automatically get the corresponding politeiawww API routes.
