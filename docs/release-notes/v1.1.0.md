politeia v1.1.0
====

This feature release includes the following feature additions.

- **Additional proposal metadata fields.** A proposal author is now required
  to provide a funding amount, start date, estimated end date, and domain
  when they submit their proposal.

- **politeiawww email rate limit.**  politeiawww users are now subject to a
  daily email rate limit to prevent malicious users from being able to
  repeatedly perform actions that result in notification emails in an attempt
  to get the email server classified as spam.

- **MySQL user database implementation.**  politeiad must be run using MySQL
  due to trillian (tlog) running on MySQL.  The user database was previously
  implemented using CockroachDB.  The addition of the MySQL user database
  implemenation allows for the removal of CockroachDB as a dependency, allowing
  Politeia to be run against a single database instance.
