/*
// activeVotes provides a cache for data that is required to validate
// vote ballots in a time efficient manner. An active vote is added to the
// cache when a vote is started and is removed from the cache lazily when a
// vote summary is created for the finished vote.
//
// This cache is required in order to increase the performance of the cast
// vote validation.
//
// Record locking is handled by the backend, not by individual plugins. This
// makes the plugin implementations simpler and easier to reason about, but it
// can also lead to performance bottlenecks for expensive plugin write
// commands. The cast ballot command is one such command due to the combination
// of requiring external dcrdata calls to verify the largest commitment
// addresses for each ticket and the fact that its possible for hundreds of
// ballots to be cast concurrently. We cache the active vote data in order to
// alleviate this bottleneck.

// activeVote caches the data required to validate vote ballots for a record
// with an active voting period.
//
// A active vote with 41k tickets will cache a maximum of 10.5 MB of data.

// potential 3 MB cast votes map if all 41k votes are cast.

	// a vote is started. It takes ~1.5 minutes to fully populate this
	// cache when the ticket pool is 41k tickets and when using an off
	// premise dcrdata instance with minimal latency. Any functions
	// that rely of this cache should fallback to fetching the
	// commitment addresses manually in the event the cache has not
