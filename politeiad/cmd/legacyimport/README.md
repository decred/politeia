# legacyimport

`legacyimport` is a tool that will be used to import the git backend legacy records
into the new tlog backend. This tool will only be used once.

## Considerations

We decided to import only the latest version of each record into tlog, and save it as
a version 1/iteration 1 record. If one wishes to check further versions of a finished
legacy record, the git repo will be available.



## Usage 

`leagcyimport`.
